# Ben's AI Prompt Library

A collection of AI prompts I've created, organized by use case and purpose. The goal is
to utilize a set of reusable building blocks to create effective prompts for various tasks.

Eventually, the management of this library will be automated via my prompt manager,
[impromptu](https://github.com/bengineerdavis/impromptu), but all prompts should be
using a version of the "seed" prompts from the [bootstrapping](../bootstrapping) folder.

## Alpha Warning

This library is in active development. Prompts and the library structure may change frequently.

## Usage

To use these prompts, you will need to copy the contents of the
[../bootstrapping](../bootstrapping) folder and upload them to your chat service as system prompts.

Once uploaded, you can use the prompts by asking for the prompt you want to use in your own words. For example, if you want to use the "Strategy Builder" prompt, you would say something like:

"Use the Strategy Builder prompt to create a plan for my next project."


A prompt should be returned, from which you can then use it to get your desired output.

The responses will be in Markdown format.
