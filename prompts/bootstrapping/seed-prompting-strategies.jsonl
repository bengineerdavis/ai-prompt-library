# seed-prompting-strategies.jsonl - Living Registry of Prompting Strategies

**This is a living, continuously-updated registry of prompting strategies available to Seed factories.**

Each line is a JSON object representing one strategy. Factories reference this registry dynamically in Phase 0.

## How to Use This Registry

### For Factory Developers

In Phase 0 of your factory, reference this registry:

```
# Load available strategies
grep "enabled.*true" seed-prompting-strategies.jsonl | jq '.name'

# Filter by use case
grep "product research" seed-prompting-strategies.jsonl | jq '.name'

# Check effectiveness
grep "effectiveness" seed-prompting-strategies.jsonl | jq '.effectiveness' | sort -rn
```

### For Orchestrator

When passing input to factory, include available strategies:

```json
{
  "strategies_allowed": [
    "Few-Shot",
    "Meta-Prompting",
    "Self-Critique"
  ],
  "strategy_registry_url": "seed-prompting-strategies.jsonl"
}
```

### For Researchers

Add new strategies by appending JSON lines:

```bash
# New strategy discovered!
echo '{"name":"New-Strategy-Name","version":"1.0","enabled":true,...}' >> seed-prompting-strategies.jsonl
```

---

## Adding New Strategies

When you discover/research a new strategy:

1. **Test it**: Validate effectiveness across 3+ domains
2. **Document**: Write implementation steps + use cases
3. **Append**: Add JSON line to this file
4. **Broadcast**: Notify Seed system (factory-builder will auto-discover)

**Template for new strategy**:

```json
{
  "name": "Strategy-Name-Here",
  "version": "1.0",
  "enabled": true,
  "description": "What this does, when to use, why it works",
  "implementation": "Step-by-step execution instructions",
  "effectiveness": 0.0,
  "best_for": ["use case 1", "use case 2"],
  "requires_multiple_runs": false,
  "computational_cost": "low|medium|high",
  "model_compatibility": ["perplexity", "qwen", "claude"],
  "added": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "updated": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "research_ref": "Paper/blog/source",
  "tags": ["tag1", "tag2"]
}
```

---

## Version History

- **v1.0 (2025-12-05)**: Initial starter set (10 core strategies)
- Future: Strategies added as discovered/validated

---

## Strategy Retirement

Strategies can be disabled (not deleted) if they underperform:

```
"enabled": false  # Factory will skip disabled strategies
```

History preserved for research.

---

## Continuous Integration

This file should be:
- **Versioned** in git (track all strategy additions)
- **Shared** across all Seed instances
- **Updated regularly** (monthly at minimum for new research)
- **Monitored** for effectiveness (track which strategies used + scored)

**This is a living registry. Factories adapt automatically as strategies evolve.** 🚀
