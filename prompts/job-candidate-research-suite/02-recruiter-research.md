# Recruiter & Hiring Manager Research Seed Prompt

## Purpose
Understand who is reaching out, their credibility, track record, and the broader hiring context (team health, stability, hiring manager style).

## Core Seed Prompt

You are helping a job candidate evaluate a recruiter and hiring team. 
Research the following and provide a structured profile:

**PART A: Recruiter Profile**
- Name: [RECRUITER_NAME]
- Current company: [COMPANY_NAME]
- LinkedIn profile: background, tenure at company, previous roles, specialties
- Track record: How many placements? In what roles/industries?
- Reputation signals: Glassdoor recruiter reviews, Blind mentions, candidate feedback on Reddit/community forums
- Outreach quality: Personalized message or spray-and-pray template? Do they understand your background?
- Communication style: Responsive? Clear about next steps?

**PART B: Hiring Manager / Team Lead Profile**
- Name: [HIRING_MANAGER_NAME]
- LinkedIn: Career trajectory, titles, companies, time at each
- Leadership signals: Posts, endorsements, articles, public talks
- Technical depth: GitHub activity, publications, conference presentations (if applicable)
- Management reputation: 
  - Glassdoor reviews of their management style
  - Blind posts mentioning their name or team
  - Any indicators of team stability or turnover
- Culture indicators: What do they value? (From LinkedIn posts, recommendations, interviews)

**PART C: Team Context**
- Team size and structure
- Recent hires (LinkedIn "People also viewed" or company LinkedIn page)
- Turnover signals: How many people have left in past 12-24 months?
- Growth trajectory: Is the team expanding or consolidating?

**PART D: Hiring Process Signals**
- Timeline: How long is the typical process?
- Feedback quality: Do they provide detailed feedback after interviews?
- Transparency: Do they explain the role requirements clearly?
- Red flags: Vague descriptions, slow communication, frequent process changes

**OUTPUT FORMAT:**
Provide findings in sections with confidence levels (High/Medium/Low) for each data point.
Highlight any gaps where information is unavailable.
Flag any red flags or concerns about recruiter credibility or team stability.
Suggest follow-up questions to ask the recruiter directly.


## How to Use

1. **Replace placeholders** with actual names and company
2. **Run this prompt** within 24 hours of recruiter outreach
3. **Use findings to decide** whether to invest time in the interview process
4. **Cross-reference** with your job fit analysis (see skill-mapping.md)
5. **Document findings** in your job search tracking sheet (see tracking-template.csv)

## Key Indicators to Watch For

  * Clarifying team health and turnover
  * Understanding the hiring manager’s style and expectations
  * Confirming the realism of the role’s scope, seniority, and growth path.
