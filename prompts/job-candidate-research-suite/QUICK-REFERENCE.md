3. **Ask hard questions early** - Don't wait until offer stage to learn dealbreakers

4. **Document everything** - Your memory blurs after 3-4 parallel processes; tracking-template.csv is your source of truth

5. **Know your walk-away numbers** - For salary, culture, commute, and growth opportunity

6. **Compare holistically** - Don't just chase highest salary; factor in team, learning, and quality of life

7. **Focus ruthlessly** - You can't give 100% to 10 opportunities; pick 2-3 and own them

## Customization Tips

**These prompts are vanilla templates.** Customize them:

1. **For your LLM**: Add "You specialize in [field]" if your model needs context
2. **For your priorities**: Add constraints (e.g., "Remote-first only" or "Series A-C stage only")
3. **For your goals**: Reference your 90-day learning plan (AI skills, leadership, security)
4. **For your workflow**: Copy the structure but rewrite examples to match your context
5. **For iteration**: After using, note what worked and update the template

Example customization:
```
Original: "Research the following company..."
Customized: "Research [Company] specifically for AI/ML engineering culture, 
since I want to deepen my LLM skills. Focus on: ML ops infrastructure, 
research opportunities, and whether they support external conferences."
```

## FAQ

**Q: Should I run all five prompts for every opportunity?**
A: Start with company + recruiter research (30-40 min, low cost). Only run skill-mapping + salary research if you're seriously considering the role.

**Q: How detailed should my tracking sheet be?**
A: Capture 1-2 sentences per field. Enough to compare across opportunities; not a journal.

**Q: What if I'm missing information for one of the prompts?**
A: The prompt will tell you "Information unavailable" or "Low confidence." That's OK—it's a signal to ask the recruiter directly.

**Q: Should I share my findings with the recruiter?**
A: Not usually. Use research to decide whether to pursue. But if you ask recruiter a follow-up question, that's your chance to validate findings.

**Q: How do I decide between competing offers?**
A: Use the comparison matrix and score each dimension (1-5). Total score helps, but also listen to gut. Best offer isn't always highest salary.
