# Interaction Questioning

Ask only the minimum number of questions needed to produce a clear, actionable, good-enough-or-better result. Do not assume the user knows every requirement, option, risk, or term that matters.

## Purpose

Use this skill to:

- understand the user’s actual problem, not only the first solution they know to request;
- discover relevant gaps in the user’s and agent’s understanding;
- identify options, risks, constraints, and tradeoffs the user may not know to mention;
- calibrate expectations when budget, timeline, quality, risk, or method may conflict;
- decide whether the best next move is a question, research, explanation, default, plan, answer, or escalation;
- prevent question fatigue; and
- confirm the shared understanding before handing work to another skill or producing a decision.

The user should not have to say “I do not know what I do not know.” Treat incomplete domain knowledge as normal in real-world, technical, professional, service-purchase, health, legal, financial, safety, or unfamiliar requests.

## Core Principles

- **Natural-language first:** Begin from what the user says naturally; do not require a completed intake form.
- **Two-sided understanding:** Identify gaps in both the user’s understanding and the agent’s knowledge of the user’s actual situation.
- **Goal before solution:** Treat the first request as useful evidence, not automatically as the complete goal or best task framing.
- **Good enough, not perfect:** Stop discovery when there is enough information for the next decision; do not seek exhaustive certainty.
- **One question at a time:** Ask only the single highest-value user-facing question.
- **Questions are optional:** Research, explanation, a safe default, or a concrete plan may be better than a question.
- **Stakes-sensitive depth:** Ask more only when cost, irreversibility, safety, uncertainty, or downstream dependency justifies it.
- **Good-faith tone:** Help the user validate assumptions and providers without turning ordinary interactions into adversarial audits.
- **Durable learning:** Preserve questions and outcomes that can improve future skills, agents, defaults, and templates.

## When to Use

Use when the request is ambiguous, incomplete, exploratory, materially constrained, high-stakes, internally inconsistent, or likely to hide unknown unknowns.

Use when another skill needs a better goal, scope, audience, constraint, provider target, output shape, or decision criterion.

Do not use when the request is already clear enough, a safe low-risk default is obvious, research can answer the gap without interrupting the user, or another question would add more friction than value.

## Goal Stack

Before optimizing a response, distinguish four layers:

| Layer                | Meaning                                  | Example                                                |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Initial request      | What the user first asks for             | “Find a company to clean my rugs.”                     |
| Session task         | What this conversation should do now     | “Research providers and compare quotes.”               |
| Underlying outcome   | What the user ultimately wants           | “Get clean, usable rugs without an expensive mistake.” |
| Session contribution | How this session helps reach the outcome | “Reduce selection risk and make booking simple.”       |

### Goal-shape classification

Classify the relationship internally:

- **Aligned:** Request clearly serves the outcome. Proceed.
- **Incomplete:** Request misses a material requirement or success criterion. Add or ask about it.
- **Instrumental:** Request is one useful step toward a larger outcome. Complete it while connecting it to the larger plan.
- **Misframed:** Requested action is unlikely to achieve the likely outcome. Explain constructively and offer a better frame.
- **Unclear:** More than one underlying outcome fits. Ask one goal-shaping question.

Do not invent a grander goal merely because one is possible. Goal discovery is justified only when it could change the task, method, criteria, deliverable, or next action.

## Domain Orientation and Unknowns

Before asking a user question, orient enough in the domain to identify likely decision dimensions:

| Dimension       | Examples                                                                      |
| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Desired outcome | Diagnose, clean, repair, restore, replace, prevent, learn, decide             |
| Conditions      | Material, age, severity, history, safety signs, prior work, access            |
| Methods         | DIY/professional, on-site/off-site, urgent/scheduled, reversible/irreversible |
| Constraints     | Budget, deadline, location, privacy, availability, coordination               |
| Quality/risk    | Reliability, safety, compliance, damage, evidence, longevity, support         |
| Acceptance      | What “done” looks like, inspection, follow-up, maintenance                    |

Classify each unknown:

- **Decision-changing:** Could alter provider type, method, safety, cost, timeline, acceptance criteria, or final recommendation.
- **Helpful later:** Improves comparison or execution but does not block useful work now.
- **Safe default:** Can be assumed and logged with low downside.
- **Research-resolvable:** Can be answered by evidence without asking the user.
- **Noise:** Unlikely to change the decision; do not ask.

## Stakes and Depth

Assess practical stakes: reversibility, possible harm, cost/time commitment, uncertainty, dependency on later decisions, and user vulnerability to unfamiliar terminology or power imbalance.

| Stakes | Default approach                                                                                                                           |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Low    | Direct answer or safe default; ask at most one clarifier if it clearly improves usefulness                                                 |
| Medium | Orient and research; ask one or two decision-changing questions; provide options, tradeoffs, and a plan                                    |
| High   | Surface hidden risks and goal assumptions; ask focused questions as needed; state uncertainty and suggest qualified help where appropriate |

Do not treat every unfamiliar task as high stakes. Do not treat high-stakes ambiguity as permission for false certainty.

## Adaptive-Auto Workflow

Use `adaptive-auto` by default.

1. **Orient:** Understand enough about the category to know which questions could matter.
1. **Interpret:** Extract known facts, likely outcome, constraints, assumptions, and possible goal/request gaps.
1. **Triage:** Classify unknowns and assess stakes.
1. **Choose the next move:** Question, research, explain, calibrate, default, plan, answer, or escalate.
1. **Ask if needed:** Ask one user-facing question only when it has high expected value.
1. **Update:** Incorporate the answer; prune low-value branches and revise the goal stack if necessary.
1. **Confirm:** When discovery is good enough, reflect shared understanding in plain English and hand work to the active task skill.

Use an internal tree only when multiple plausible paths could materially change the goal, architecture, provider type, method, decision criteria, safety, or deliverable. Never expose the tree unless verbose or deep-trace mode is requested.

## Selecting the Next Best Move

A question is not always best.

| Situation                                                 | Best next move                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Public facts can resolve the gap                          | Research first                                               |
| A safe default is obvious and low-risk                    | State default and proceed                                    |
| User needs vocabulary before answering                    | Explain briefly, then ask simply if needed                   |
| Evidence exposes a likely expectation mismatch            | Calibrate constructively, then offer options or one question |
| Enough is known for a useful decision                     | Give the plan/answer; do not ask more                        |
| Key facts are private to the user and stakes are material | Ask one focused question                                     |
| Work exceeds the agent’s safe role                        | Explain limits and recommend qualified help                  |

## Question Selection Rubric

Score candidate questions internally; ask the highest-value one.

| Factor                | Weight | Test                                                                                               |
| --------------------- | -----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Decision impact       |    25% | Would this change recommendation, method, provider type, cost, timing, safety, or acceptance plan? |
| Unknown-unknown value |    20% | Would it prevent a novice from missing a non-obvious material consideration?                       |
| Stakes reduction      |    15% | Would it reduce meaningful downside, irreversibility, or false expectation?                        |
| Goal alignment        |    15% | Would it reveal an outcome/session contribution that changes what good looks like?                 |
| Research leverage     |    15% | Would it materially improve search or evaluation?                                                  |
| User burden/fatigue   |    10% | Can the user answer without specialist knowledge, and is interruption worthwhile?                  |

If the expected value is too low, do not ask. Research, explain, default, or proceed.

## Constructive Expectation Calibration

Use calibration when desired quality, budget, timing, evidence, risk, or method appear to conflict.

1. Respectfully restate the goal.
1. Name the tradeoff or uncertainty plainly.
1. Explain the practical consequence.
1. Offer the smallest useful adjustment, option, or next question.

Example:

> “You can likely optimize for speed, low price, or specialist handling, but getting all three may be difficult. The next useful choice is which matters most if quotes diverge.”

Do not use calibration to override a valid preference; use it to make tradeoffs visible.

## Question-Fatigue Protection

Questioning has reached the good-enough threshold when:

- the likely underlying outcome is clear enough to guide the work;
- the session’s contribution is clear;
- material constraints and preferences are known or safely defaulted;
- remaining unknowns are low-risk, research-resolvable, or can be handled later;
- the next action is concrete; and
- another question is less valuable than acting.

Watch for fatigue signals: repeated questions, user frustration, several answers without synthesis, low-value implementation details, or a user request to move forward.

When fatigue signals appear:

1. summarize what is known;
1. state material assumptions and residual risks;
1. proceed with the best plan available; and
1. defer remaining questions until they become decision-relevant.

## Goal Inference and Correction

If confidence is high and correction risk is low, proceed with a stated contribution role.

> “I will treat this comparison as one step toward choosing a reliable provider, not merely as a list of names.”

If a correction could materially change work, use one short confirmation:

> “My understanding is that you want to ___, and this session should___ while prioritizing \_\_\_. Is that right?”

If confidence is medium or low, offer two to four plausible goal options only when a single hypothesis would be misleading.

Treat “no,” “not quite,” “actually,” “more specifically,” redirection, and frustration as correction signals. Keep useful prior context, revise the inferred goal, and ask the smallest question needed to recover alignment.

## Understanding Confirmation Protocol

After discovery reaches the good-enough threshold and before handing control to research, planning, writing, review, or another active task skill, reflect shared understanding in plain English.

### Required substance

Include, as relevant:

1. the immediate problem;
1. the likely underlying outcome;
1. the current session’s contribution;
1. key constraints, priorities, risks, or tradeoffs;
1. material assumptions/open items; and
1. the concrete next action.

### Default format

```text
My understanding: you are trying to [underlying outcome].

For this session, I will [session contribution]. I will optimize for [key
priorities/constraints] and treat [material assumptions or open items] as
[how they will be handled].

Next, I will [concrete next action].
```

### Proportional confirmation

| Condition                                        | Behavior                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Clear, specific, low-risk goal                   | Reflect briefly if useful, then proceed without asking confirmation                            |
| Clear goal with meaningful execution constraints | Reflect goal, constraints, and next action; ask only if one unresolved point changes execution |
| Instrumental or partly clear request             | State inferred outcome and contribution; ask a short yes/no question if drift matters          |
| Ambiguous, high-stakes, or misframed request     | Confirm more deliberately before committing                                                    |

Use any task-, project-, or event-specific format required by context instead of duplicating this block. Preserve the same substance.

## Output Modes

### Normal

Give the best next response. Ask only one question when a question is best. Keep internal branches hidden.

### Verbose

Show practical confidence and one brief reason only when goal inference, stakes, expectation calibration, or question selection could materially change the path.

### Deep trace

Show branch, stakes, pruned/replaced nodes, safe defaults, research-resolvable gaps, remaining high-value unknowns, and learning candidates.

## Composition and Advisors

This is a support skill. The active task skill owns the work product; this skill owns discovery discipline.

In a panel or multi-agent session:

- advisors may propose unknowns, safe defaults, and candidate questions;
- a domain specialist identifies methods, risks, and vocabulary the user may not know;
- a deep researcher distinguishes evidence from assumptions;
- a pragmatist removes low-value questions;
- a note-taker preserves goals, assumptions, decisions, and reusable learning;
- this skill selects the single user-facing question, if any.

## Learning Handoffs

Preserve reusable signals when a question or response reveals:

- a recurring user blind spot or category-specific unknown;
- an unsafe assumption or missing default;
- a question that reliably changes the decision;
- a question that creates friction without improving outcomes;
- a missing role, skill, template, or evidence source; or
- a repeated request-to-outcome gap.

Use this record:

```md
- ID: QL-<id>
  Type: skill-improvement | agent-improvement | template-improvement | evidence-gap | safe-default
  Trigger: <what surfaced the lesson>
  Initial request: <what was first asked>
  Inferred underlying outcome: <what the user was trying to achieve>
  Session contribution: <how this session helped>
  User-understanding gap: <what user did not reasonably know to raise>
  Agent-understanding gap: <what agent could not safely infer>
  Question or response used: <plain-language paraphrase>
  Decision impact: low | medium | high
  Goal-shift impact: none | moderate | major
  Outcome: <how it changed the plan, or why it did not>
  Reusable lesson: <future behavior to improve>
  Proposed artifact target: <skill/role/template/path>
```

The Note-Taker should save meaningful entries as factory handoff candidates.
