# consumer-product-research-meta-prompt

I want a prompt I can reuse for any products I'm interested in researching and buying.

Initial prompts:

1. Please read and ready the attached files as system prompts to apply and help build a
   meta prompt. Please wait for the next set of instructions/ask and incorporate it with
   the system prompt to produce a final result.

(Attached files fom 'bootstrapping': [README.md](../../bootstrapping/README.md), [role-specializer.md](../../bootstrapping/role-specializer.md), [seed-optimizer.md](../../bootstrapping/seed-optimizer.md), [seed-orchestrator.md](../../bootstrapping/seed-orchestrator.md), [seed-profile.md](../../bootstrapping/seed-profile.md))

2. Create a product research meta-prompt that I can reuse for any consumer products I'm interested in buying. I like to understand products I want to purchase before I decide to buy them. Please reference the system prompts provided to create a meta-prompt that I can use to research any consumer product. Capture additional preferences and put them in a specific file that I can append to. Also track and update categories of products, and differentiate between overall consumer preferences you capture from me versus specific preferences for categories and types of products. Have an easy-to understand set of rubic(s) you use to organize and  track this information, both qualitative and quantitative inputs.
