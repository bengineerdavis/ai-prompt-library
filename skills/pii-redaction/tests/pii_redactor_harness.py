"""Constants shared by the pii-redactor fixtures and tests.

Deliberately not conftest.py: every conftest is imported as a top-level
module named `conftest`, so `from conftest import ...` resolves to whichever
one pytest imported first. `SCRIPT` in particular is defined by both this
suite and tests/clipped, so a shared conftest slot resolves it to the wrong
binary without raising. See tests/guards/guard_harness.py.

    """The pii-redactor source, whether or not it has been deployed.

    The suite used to hardcode `~/bin/pii-redactor`. That file exists only
    after `chezmoi apply`, so on a fresh clone — and in CI — the whole suite
    failed on `FileNotFoundError`, which was 55 of CI's 64 failures.

    The tests need the script's SOURCE, which is always present in the repo.
    The deployed copy is NOT preferred, and that is a reversal of 40fbf6c8.
    Preferring it meant a change made in a worktree was tested only after
    `chezmoi apply`, which agents may not run from a worktree (main only) —
    so the suite silently graded the last deployed code and reported a pass on
    a file nobody had run. Measured 2026-11-11: a `-R` fix in the source failed
    two tests against the stale deployed copy, then passed once applied.

    The source is stored mode 644: chezmoi records `executable_` in the name
    and applies the bit at deploy time. Running it in place therefore fails
    with `PermissionError`, so it is copied to a temp directory and marked
    executable rather than chmod-ing a tracked file (which would dirty the
    working tree and fight the chezmoi state).

    `PII_REDACTOR_SCRIPT` overrides the resolution, so a caller that really
    does want to grade another copy can say so explicitly.
